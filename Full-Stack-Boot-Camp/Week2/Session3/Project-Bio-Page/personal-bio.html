                <!-- Include: h2 "About Me", professional photo with alt text, 2-3 paragraphs about yourself -->
                <p>I am a customer service professional of 10 years looking to make a career transition into web and software development.
                    To that end I have been studying with Codecademy for 2 years, and have learning experience with 
                    <abbr title='Hypertext Markup Langage'>HTML</abbr>, <abbr title='Cascading Style Sheets'>CSS</abbr>, python and <abbr title='Structured Query Langage'>SQL</abbr>.
                    My experience in customer service lends itself to programming in that I have experience working with others,
                    problem solving both individually and with a team, and working with customers to find products and solutions to problems.
                </p>
                <p>I discovered my love for coding after playing the game "While True: Learn()" and taking the game's suggesion "If you like this game, try learning to code!"
                    Python was my first language, suggested due to its relative simplicity compared to some other languages.
                    I absolutely fell in love, it reminded me of every puzzle game I ever enjoyed and I just could not stop doing problems on 
                    <abbr title="Don Mills Online Judge or Modern Online Judge"><a href="https://dmoj.ca/">DMOJ</a></abbr>.
                    Since then my love of programming has expanded to multiple languages. One day I hope to take my passion for development and problem solving to a professional level.
                </p>
                <p>When I'm not studying, you can find me playing my favorite puzzle games or getting together with friends to play our favorite
